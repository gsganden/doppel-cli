## Integrations <a name="integrations"></a>

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>

### Finding bugs using smoke tests <a name="smokey"></a>

A set of smoke tests are available that you can use to help find bugs in `doppel-cli`.

To see if `doppel-cli` works for Python and R packages it has been shown to work for in the past, run

```
./smoke_tests/run.sh $(pwd)/smoke_tests/test_data
```

To try running `doppel-cli` against all R packages installed on your system (in random order), run

```
./smoke_tests/all_r_packages.sh $(pwd)/smoke_tests/test_data
```

If anything breaks, [create an issue](https://github.com/jameslamb/doppel-cli/issues) that includes the logs of the run and the results of running `Rscript -e 'sessionInfo()'`.

### Testing releases: test PyPi

PyPi is the official package manage used for distributing Python packages. A "test" version is provided for side effect free integration testing.

To test whether the current state of publishing `doppel` plays nicely with PyPi, maintainers may from time to time run the following:

```
./publish.sh testpypi
```

To actually publish a new version, run:

```
./publish.sh pypi
```
